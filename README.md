## project description

this project is a landing page:a page that has multiple sctions(four sections at least) each section has text content steps 

## technologies

### section

i created the forth section with DOM using append,appendChild,createElement

### navigation bar and anchor elements

1.i built the navigation bar to navigate between sections dynamically using a for loop i created anchor elements and gave them href 
and textContent and Id ..etc
2.added event listener to the click on anchor elements to go to target section with smooth scroll instead of default jump

### active section

with the help of  the active function i created viewed section after clicking on anchor element has active class as a result it's highlighted

### go to top button

i created a button that only appears when user begins to scroll with scrolling percentage of 10% or more to click and go to top of the page 

### scrolling and active section

i added an event listner to scrolling that checks what section is being viewed now by passing section to isInViewport function that returns true or false and according to 
the answer viewed sections is highlighted
